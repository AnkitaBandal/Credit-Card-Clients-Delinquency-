This project's main aim is to predict credit card delinquency for the upcoming month, and we are using a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset has 30,000 instances, 24 features, and one target variable, including credit limit, demographic details, payment history, and bill statements.
Prepared the dataset for model training by meticulously processing the data and engineering features. The preprocessing included handling irregularities in categorical variables, and we introduced a derived feature called 'Total_due.'
Developed four machine learning algorithms, which are Logistic Regression using Gradient Descent, Hard-Margin SVM, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and a Neural Network implemented via TensorFlow and Keras. We evaluated each model based on precision, recall, accuracy, and other relevant metrics.
Our focus was to assess predictive power and computational efficiency. The models' performances provided insights that could aid financial institutions in mitigating risks and making decisions related to credit lending.
