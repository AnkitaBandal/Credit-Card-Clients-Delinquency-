This project centers on forecasting credit card delinquency for the upcoming month, utilizing a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. With 30,000 instances and 24 features encompassing credit limit, demographics, payment history, and bill statements, we meticulously processed the data, addressing irregularities in categorical variables and introducing the derived feature 'Total_due.'

The dataset was prepped for model training, and four machine learning algorithms were implemented: Logistic Regression using Gradient Descent, Hard-Margin SVM, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and a Neural Network via TensorFlow and Keras. Evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, accuracy, and computational efficiency were employed to assess predictive power. The outcomes offer valuable insights for financial institutions, aiding in risk mitigation and informed credit lending decisions.
